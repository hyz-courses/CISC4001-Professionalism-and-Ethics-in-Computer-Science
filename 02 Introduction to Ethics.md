# 2.2 Nine Ethical Theories
## 2.2.1 Five Workable Theories
### WT_1. Kantianism 康德主义
**Definition**
- Formulation 1: If the rule still works well when universalized, it's ok.
- Formulation 2: Don't use others as a means to an end.

**Evaluation**
- Post:
	- Align with common moral concern.
		- *"What if everyone acted this way?"*
	- Produces universal moral guidelines.
	- Treats all persons as moral equals.
	- Distinction between **perfect** and **imperfect** duties.
		- Perfect duty: Duty obliged to fulfill without exception.
			- *e.g., telling the truth*
		- Imperfect duty: Duty obliged to fulfill in general, but with exception.
			- *e.g., helping others*
- Against:
	- Sometimes an action can't be categorized by a rule adequately enough.
		- *e.g., Stealing food to feed my children. Stealing? Caring for children? ...*
	- Sometimes Kantianism can't resolve conflict between rules.
		- *Perfect duty prevails in a conflict with an imperfect duty.*
	- Does not allow any exceptions to perfect duties.

### WT_2. Act Utilitarianism 行为功利主义
**Definition**
- Applies the *Principle of Utility* to Actions (Jeremy Bentham & John Stuart Mill)
	- Good Action $\leftarrow$ Its benefits exceeds harms.
	- Bad Action $\leftarrow$ Its harms exceeds benefits.
	- An action is right or wrong to the extent that it increases or decreases the total happiness of the affected parties.
- Principle of Utility (Greatest Happiness Principle)
	- Utility: Tendency of an object to 
		- produce happiness or 
		- prevent unhappiness
	- Happiness: Advantage, benefit, good, pleasure.
	- Unhappiness: Disadvantage, cost, evil, pain.
- Utilitarianism: A consequentialist theory.
	- Morality of an action is determined only by its consequences, having no relation with its intent.
- Act Utilitarianism:
	- $\sum \text{happiness} - \sum \text{harm} > 0$, action is good.
	- $\sum \text{happiness} - \sum \text{harm} < 0$, action is bad.
	- Right action: $\text{argmax}(\sum \text{happiness} - \sum \text{harm})$

**Evaluation**
- Post:
	- Focuses on happiness.
	- Practical, down-to-earth.
	- Comprehensive.
- Against:
	- Unclear who to include and how far in the future to consider.
	- Too much work.
	- Ignores our innate sense of duty.
	- We can't predict consequences with certainty.
	- *Moral Luck:* An bad action in consequence with good intention.

### WT_3. Rule Utilitarianism 规则功利主义
**Definition**
- A universal rule that greatest increases total happiness if followed by everyone.
- Application of Principle of Utility:
	- Act Utilitarianism: Individual moral actions.
	- Rule Utilitarianism: Moral rules.

**Evaluation**
- Post:
	- Not every moral decision requires performing utilitarian calculus.
	- Moral rules survive exceptional situations, *e.g., Moral Luck.*
	- Reduces the problem of biases.
	- Widely accepted.
- Against
	- Needs a *single scale* to measure all consequences.
	- Ignores the problem of an unjust distribution of good consequences.

### WT_4. Social Contract Theory 社会契约理论
**Definition**
- Thomas Hobbes: We implicitly accept a social contract with:
	- Establishment of moral rules to govern relations among citizens.
	- and the government is capable of enforcing these rules.
- Jean-Jacques Rousseau:
	- *No one is above rules* in an ideal society.

- Kinds of rights:
	- Negative right: Others guarantee by leaving you alone.
		- *e.g., right of free speech.*
	- Positive right: Others obliges to do something on your behalf.
		- *e.g., right for free education.*
	- Absolute right: A right guaranteed without exception.
	- Limited Right: A right restricted based on the circumstances.

- John Rawl's Principles of Justice:
	- Each person may claim a "fully adequate" number of basic rights & liberties.
		- as long as these claims are **consistent** with everyone else who claim to the same rights & liberties.
	- Any social & economic inequalities must:
		- Be associated with **positions that everyone has a fair & equal opportunity to achieve.** 
		- Be to the **greatest benefit of the least-advantaged people.**

**Evaluation**
- Post:
	- Framed in the language of "rights".
	- Explains why people act in self-interest in absence of common agreement.
	- Provides clear analysis of certain citizen/government problems.
- Against:
	- Not formal after all: No one signed the contract.
	- Some actions have multiple characterizations.
	- Conflicting rights problem.
	- Unjustly treat people incapable of upholding contract.

	- Arete, virtue, excellence
- Two types of virtue:
	- Intellectual virtues: Virtues associated with reasoning and truth.
	- Moral virtues: Virtues of character. *e.g., honesty, ...*
- Vices:
	- Opposite of virtues.
	- A character trait that prevents a human being from flourishing/truly happy.
	- Often on the two side of a virtue:
		- *Cowardliness $\leftarrow$ Courage $\rightarrow$ Rashness*
